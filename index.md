title: Humans of Generative AI 2026

# Overview

The design of generative AI and computer vision systems is often guided by technical
benchmarks and in-lab evaluations that can differ from their real-world uses. This misalignment,
at best, can lead to inefficiencies and, at worst, cause unintended harms in unforeseen contexts.

"Humans of Generative AI" recenters attention on the people who use and are affected by these
systems. We invite talks and posters from human-centric research that inform the design or
evaluation of generative AI and computer vision systems. Through this workshop, we will
encourage and develop cross-disciplinary collaboration between computer vision and human-
centric researchers, two often disconnected communities.




### Topic 1. Social Science Findings That Inform the Technical Design of AI Systems.
As AI systems begin to see widespread adoption and use by an increasing number of real users, these systems will inevitably be
used in unanticipated scenarios. A core focus of this workshop is human-centered research that informs the design of technical systems. From these discussions, we aim to connect human-centric insights with the technical limitations and design choices of current systems, identifying directions for future research.

### Topic 2.  Technical Designs That Consider Unattended Needs of Real-World Users.
As a direct response
to Topic 1, this Topic 1 continues the conversation by presenting technical designs that fulfill unmet needs
or protect against unattended harms in existing AI systems. 
to Topic 1, this Topic 1 continues the conversation by presenting technical designs that fulfill unmet needs
or protect against unattended harms in existing AI systems. Social Science Findings That Inform the Technical Design of AI Systems.
In this topic, we will broadly discuss how these socio-technically informed findings of those effects can be translated into concrete design goals for researchers.
